[[{"l":"Welcome","p":["Welcome to the Change Code Knowledgebase. At Change Code we're building the tools for individuals and organizations to attest to and verify their impact and package that data into a meaningfully representative impact asset. Ultimately, the goal of these assets is to provide an unrestricted, but still accountable revenue stream, reducing the cost of social enterprise and eventually removing the need for continuous and unpredictable outside funding. Change Code is creating financial and data primitives that reliably and scalably represent impact outputs and just as important, longer-term impact outcomesâ€”pioneering token-based representations of consumable and capital impact assets.","At the core of Change Code's work is our belief that in order to actualy achieve the world's sustainability and other impact goals, we must find a way to make purpose profitable. We are working to pioneer new financial primitives and tokenomics that will see impact itself emerge as the next asset class to be powered by web3.","The Changescape is a multi-chain and multi-token dApp (decentralized application) engineered to support the tokenization, verification, and ultimate monetization of a new asset category, postive impact.","If you're interested in contributing to our work, navigate over to the Contributor Guide."]}],[{"l":"Foundations","p":["Change Credits are a novel financial primitive supporting resource allocation, verification, and tracking of positive externalities (social and environmental impact).","They are the basis and grounding of Change Code's economic engine, providing a real-world tangible link to underpin a new form of beneficial currency."]},{"l":"Supporting Primitives and Infrastructure","p":["Before expanding on the architecture and processes involved in Change Credits directly, we should first recap (or introduce) some of the existing open-source tools and standards leveraged here."]},{"l":"Hypercerts","p":["Hypercerts are on-chain, tokenized claims of positive impact. To be more precise, hypercerts represent claims of work done toward some beneficial outcome, be that work toward social or environmental impact or the building of a public good.","A complete list of the on-chain token data and off-chain metadata included in a hypercert can be found in the documentation. Importantly for our purposes and designs, there is no included support for verification that the work was completed or efficacious. This will therefore be addressed using another foundation public good, the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). However, the hypercerts specification does include a field for a list of contributors. Change Credits takes advantage of this encoding to record contributions of the actual work being done, while tracking financial partners through ownership of Change Credits themselves."]},{"i":"ethereum-attestation-service-eas","l":"Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)","p":["Change Code leverages the EAS to allow experts and representatives of affected communities to verify (attest to) any work done that is claimed to be impactful or contribute to a public good.","While not tokens themselves (more on that here), these attestations are cryptographically secured and can be used by project partners and the public to confirm all verifications of a project's work."]},{"l":"Token Standards","p":["To maintain maximum compatibility across existing wallets and infrastructure, the Change Credits architecture leverages only broadly accepted ERC token standards. Change Credits themselves are minted as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) through the ERC721 standard.","ERC721 is the most widely adopted token standard for NFTs. The standard is well tested, and enjoys near universal support across wallet implementations.","Hypercerts adhere to the ERC1155 standard for semi-fungible tokens. This mixed standard, existing in the divide between fungible and non-fungible tokens, offers ideal flexibility for the unique requirements of the hypercerts standard.","ERC20 tokens are fully fungible and well suited for liquidity and open exchange. IOUs issued in anticipation of Change Credits are minted as ERC20 tokens to support the emergence of free exchange by holders who may wish to access liquidity.","Referred to as \"token bound accounts\" (TBAs), ERC6551 tokens function as a form of smart contract wallet where an account is simultaneously able hold or mint tokens itself and be considered a token (an NFT more specifically) in its own right. Change Code leverages TBAs to serve as treasury accounts for the receipt of funds into projects and the minting of Change Credits."]}],[{"l":"Minting Change Credits","p":["Because Change Credits are only minted following confirmation of realized, tangible, and verifiable impact, there the process by which these assets are created follows a number of steps and involves multiple types of actors."]},{"l":"Participants","p":["A Good Generator is the implementing organization responsible for seeing the planned impact results achieved. It is through the actions of this entity, often an NGO or social enterprise, that positive externalities are produced. Because contributions and funds can be seamlessly fractionalized and divided, a Good Generator can also be a collection of multiple contributors working collaboratively.","Change Code acts to provide all necessary infrastructure for the creation and management of Change Credits through its Changescape. While Change Code is not involved in the measurement or verification of any results produced, it is responsible for assessing the legitimacy and compliance of any organizations seeking to mint Change Credits.","Partners financially contribute to the positive externalities embodied in Change Credits. They fund the delivery of impact by pre-purchasing Change Credits in advance.","Verifiers exist to both validate, measure, and quantify any impact produced. Verifiers are defined by the Good Generator of the project with a focus on local context and relevant expertise. Verification can be conducted by a single individual or organization or the responsibility can be dispersed through a set of Verifiers with a specified quorum required."]},{"l":"Minting Flow","p":["The above sequence diagram overviews how Change Credits are created. While the system supports alternative flows to facilitate various forms of financing, we can consider this base form to have x steps.","The Good Generator submits an impact goal and plan for review by Change Code, as part of their onboarding process. Once approved to mint via the Changescape, the Good Generator mints their hypercert, signalling the beginning for their project.","After the projects' hypercert has been deployed, Change Code deploys an associated Token Bound Account (TBA) to act as a treasury for the project to receive funds into and mint tokens from.","Partners begin contributing funds into the project's TBA in exchange for IOUs redeemable for Change Credits once the latter begin to be minted. These funds are then remitted to an account from which the Good Generator can spend to cover the costs of their work. This process can be done in an open-ended asynchronous manner, with funds being contributed to the project through the project's lifespan.","As the Good Generator carries out their work to produce impact, they periodically submit evidence for review. This evidence is stored as records tied to their original hypercert and can be accessed by specified Verifiers.","Once evidence is confirmed by Verifiers, Change Code intakes the data provided to assign a quantity of Change Credits to be created and mints them via the project's TBA.","With Change Credits minted and available via the TBA, the project's Partners can redeem their IOUs and receive their proportional share of Change Credits."]}],[{"l":"Hypercerts","p":["Change Code leverages the Hypercerts protocol, in turn developed from the ERC1155 token standard for semi-fungible tokens. While adhering to the requirements of the standard, Change Code modifies how some of the schema fields are used, adapting them to our theory of change and implementation needs."]},{"l":"ERC1155 Fields","p":["The Hypercert name mirrors the name used for a project's IOUs. The concept of an index is again used to support single organizations working across multiple initiatives.","A description, not exceeding 200 characters, of the work to be done by the project.","While the image field is required by the Hypercerts standard, we do not believe a single immutable image to be valuable for the purposes of serious impact validation. To satisfy this requirement, the Changescape backend will automatically generate and provide an image to satisfy the requirement."]},{"l":"Hypercert Dimensions","p":["A list of tasks to be done by the project. In development parlance this is a list of outputs--e.g. # of solar panels installed, kilos of supplies, $ of direct aid, # of vaccines.","The time period during which the work for the project is to be carried out. In line with the Hypercerts standard, this is represented as an ordered pair of UTC timestamps.","Inside the Changescape impact scope is used to refer thematically to projects by category. For example, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or the Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF). Because the Hypercerts data is only aspirational, it would be premature to immutably publish indicators, which are instead reserved to be published only once verified inside Change Credits.","The time period during which impact outcomes will be measured and calculated. For Hypercerts inside the Changescape, the start time is set equal to the start time for the work_timeframe while the end time is set for the end of the work period plus five (5) years. Again this data is represented as an ordered pair of UTC timestamps.","A list of participants (organizations) that are contributing to the work done in the project. Each element in the list is composed of an on-chain address, a name, and a weight. The purpose of the weight is to signal relative contribution and may optionally be used to weight distributions among contributors.","As of version 1.0 of the Hypercerts standard, this value can only be set to public display. As it is a required field, Change Code simply applies the default value but does not otherwise use this information.","In development"]},{"l":"Example Hypercert Dimensions","p":["Additional details on the Hypercerts implementation itself can be found in the documentation here."]}],[{"l":"IOUs","p":["IOUs are implemented as ERC20 (fungible) tokens, to maximize both compatibility with existing tools and to streamline the transferability of IOUs before they are redeemed for Change Credits.","To define a batch of IOUs inside the Changescape the following specifications are made:","The token name assigned to each batch of IOUs always begins with \"CC IOU\", this is then followed by the name of the Good Generator and an index. The purpose of the index is to differentiate between different projects from one Good Generator.","The abbreviated token symbol begins \"CC-IOU\" and is followed by a project ID, where the project ID is composed of the unique ID assigned to the project's Good Generator followed by the project's index value.","The supply of a project's IOUs will vary over its lifecycle. Initially, Change Code will mint a target number of tokens as specified in the project's minted hypercert. As IOUs are redeemed for Change Credits, the IOUs returned to the TBA are subsequently burned.","IOUs are implemented including the ERC20Capped extension. As such, the Good Generator can specify that the supply of all IOUs is capped at the initial supply set in their target.","For more information regarding the ERC20 token standard, we refer you to documentation maintained by OpenZeppelin here."]}],[{"l":"Community Code of Conduct"},{"l":"Our Pledge","p":["We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.","We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community."]},{"l":"Our Standards","p":["Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:","Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people;","Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences;","Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback;","Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience;","Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community;","Examples of unacceptable behavior include:","The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind;","Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks;","Public or private harassment;","Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, or revealing any pseudonymous identity without their explicit permission;","Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting"]},{"l":"Enforcement Responsibilities","p":["Change Code's leadership is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.","Change Code has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.","Enforcement of this code will sometimes be a challenging exercise in judgement and conflicting values.
