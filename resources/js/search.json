[[{"l":"Welcome","p":["Welcome to the Change Code Knowledgebase. At Change Code we're building the tools for individuals and organizations to attest to and verify their impact and package that data into a meaningfully representative impact asset. Ultimately, the goal of these assets is to provide an unrestricted but still accountable revenue stream, reducing the cost of social enterprise and eventually removing the need for continuous and unpredictable outside funding. Change Code is creating financial and data primitives that reliably and scalably represent impact outputs, and just as importantly, longer-term impact outcomesâ€”pioneering token-based representations of consumable and capital impact assets.","At the core of Change Code's work is our belief that in order to actually achieve the world's sustainability and other impact goals, we must find a way to make purpose profitable. We are working to pioneer new financial primitives and tokenomics that will see impact itself emerge as the next asset class to be powered by web3.","The Changescape is a multi-chain and multi-token dApp (decentralized application) engineered to support the tokenization, verification, and ultimate monetization of a new asset category, positive impact.","If you're interested in contributing to our work, navigate over to the Contributor Guide."]}],[{"l":"Foundations","p":["Change Credits are a novel financial primitive supporting resource allocation, verification, and tracking of positive externalities (social and environmental impact).","They are the basis and grounding of Change Code's economic engine, providing a real-world tangible link to underpin a new form of beneficial currency."]},{"l":"Supporting Primitives and Infrastructure","p":["Before expanding on the architecture and processes involved in Change Credits directly, we should first recap (or introduce) some of the existing open-source tools and standards leveraged here."]},{"l":"Hypercerts","p":["Hypercerts are on-chain, tokenized claims of positive impact. To be more precise, hypercerts represent claims of work to be done toward some beneficial outcome, be that work toward social or environmental impact or the building of a public good.","It is worth noting that the relationship between Hypercerts and the status of positive impact is not currently settled. Some usages lean toward only representing work already done while other implementations represent plans for future work as Hypercerts instead. Inside the Change Code implementation, we will default to the latter interpretation, with Hypercerts issued as a way to commit to future work.","A complete list of the on-chain token data and off-chain metadata included in a hypercert can be found in the documentation. Importantly, for our purposes and designs, there is no included support for verification that the work was completed or efficacious. This will therefore be addressed using another foundation public good, the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). However, the hypercerts specification does include a field for a list of contributors. Change Credits takes advantage of this encoding to record contributions of the actual work done, while tracking financial partners through ownership of Change Credits themselves."]},{"i":"ethereum-attestation-service-eas","l":"Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)","p":["Change Code leverages the EAS to allow experts and representatives of affected communities to verify (attest to) any work done that is claimed to be impactful or contribute to a public good.","While not tokens themselves (more on that here), these attestations are cryptographically secured and can be used by project partners and the public to confirm all verifications of a project's work."]},{"l":"Token Standards","p":["To maintain maximum compatibility across existing wallets and infrastructure, the Change Credits architecture leverages only broadly accepted ERC token standards. Change Credits themselves are minted as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) through the ERC721 standard.","ERC721 is the most widely adopted token standard for NFTs. The standard is well-tested, and enjoys near-universal support across wallet implementations.","Hypercerts adhere to the ERC1155 standard for semi-fungible tokens. This mixed standard, existing in the divide between fungible and non-fungible tokens, offers ideal flexibility for the unique requirements of the hypercerts standard.","ERC20 tokens are fully fungible and well suited for liquidity and open exchange. IOUs issued in anticipation of Change Credits are minted as ERC20 tokens to support the emergence of free exchange by holders who may wish to access liquidity.","Referred to as \"token bound accounts\" (TBAs), ERC6551 tokens function as a form of smart contract wallet where an account is simultaneously able hold or mint tokens itself and be considered a token (an NFT more specifically) in its own right. Change Code leverages TBAs to serve as treasury accounts for the receipt of funds into projects and the minting of Change Credits."]},{"l":"Network Infrastructure","p":["To maximize the reach of our work and do our best to always meet changemakers where they are, the Changescape is designed as a cross-chain or multi-chain protocol. Leveraging shared tools and being available to existing communities across different ecosystems is among our most important design considerations."]},{"l":"Blockchain"},{"l":"Optimism","p":["Initial smart contracts for the Changescape are being deployed onto the Optimism L2 mainnet. The Optimism community has demonstrated a deep commitment toward positive impact, both inside of and beyond climate specific initiatives. Moreover, the technology involved in the OP Stack is among the most closely aligned with the the Ethereum core and its roadmap prioritizes key pieces of the Ethereum ecosystem that are critical to Change Code, such as EAS."]},{"l":"Celo","p":["For years the Celo blockchain stood out as the largest layer 1 blockchain network focused around positive impact. The network is currently undergoing a transition to enter the Optimism orbit as a part of the upcoming Optimism Superchain. Change Code is closely following the advances of both Celo and the Superchain to eventually migrate our primary deployments when the time is right."]},{"l":"Aztec","p":["While not currently emphasized in many circles focused on ReFi (regenerative finance) or public goods, the issue of privacy is something that we view as central to our long term vision and needs. It is often neglected that working for the benefit of all is a privilege and that while it may be safe for those in the West or the Global North to advance climate initiatives, engage in investigative journalism, or attempt to advocate for peace, many are not as fortunate. There are many situations in which climate action can be and is met with threats and physical violence, where educating women or ethnic minorities can make one a target of ideologues, or where it is impossible to mediate for peace without being at risk from extremists on either side of the divide.","For these reasons and many more, Change Code has a long term interest in the use of zero-knowledge and other privacy preserving technology. We are actively researching to eventually upgrade our protocol to support project deployments where any identifying information about participants can be publicly shielded while still enabling robust verification. Aztec, together with it's smart contract language Noir, presents the ideal route to achieve this vision."]},{"l":"Interoperability","p":["Beyond any choices for which networks may be used to deploy the logic for the Changescape, is the question of where various tokens--IOUs, Change Credits, and Mutual Money--may be accessed. To make Change Credit tokens accessible across chains, while avoiding centralized bridges and potential honeypots which can be drained by attackers, Change Code is integrating LayerZero for cross-chain token transfers.","While this list will grow overtime, Change Code is currently prioritizing building connections to make our tokens available on Arbitrum and Solana as both chains have substantial ReFi and public goods communities."]}],[{"l":"Minting Change Credits","p":["Because Change Credits are only minted following confirmation of realized, tangible, and verifiable impact, the process by which these assets are created follows a number of steps and involves multiple types of actors."]},{"l":"Participants","p":["A Good Generator is the implementing organization responsible for seeing the planned impact results achieved. It is through the actions of this entity, often an NGO or social enterprise, that positive externalities are produced. Because contributions and funds can be seamlessly fractionalized and divided, a Good Generator can also be a collection of multiple contributors working collaboratively.","Change Code acts to provide all necessary infrastructure for the creation and management of Change Credits through its Changescape. While the Changescape does not itself measure or verify of any results produced, Change Code as the administrator of the Changescape is responsible for assessing the legitimacy and compliance of any organizations seeking to mint Change Credits.","Partners financially contribute to the positive externalities embodied in Change Credits. They fund the delivery of impact by pre-purchasing Change Credits in advance.","Verifiers exist to both validate, measure, and quantify any impact produced. Verifiers are defined by the Good Generator of the project with a focus on local context and relevant expertise. Verification can be conducted by a single individual or organization or the responsibility can be dispersed through a set of Verifiers with a specified quorum required."]},{"l":"Minting Flow","p":["The above sequence diagram overviews how Change Credits are created. While the system supports alternative flows to facilitate various forms of financing, we can consider this base form to have x steps.","The Good Generator submits an impact goal and plan for review, as part of their onboarding process. Once approved to mint via the Changescape, the Good Generator mints their hypercert, signaling the beginning for their project.","After the projects' hypercert has been deployed, Change Code deploys an associated Token Bound Account (ERC6511) to act as a treasury for the project to receive funds into and mint tokens from.","Partners begin contributing funds into the project's TBA in exchange for IOUs redeemable for Change Credits once the latter begin to be minted. These funds are then remitted to an account from which the Good Generator can spend to cover the costs of their work. This process can be done in an open-ended asynchronous manner, with funds being contributed to the project through the project's lifespan.","As the Good Generator carries out their work to produce impact, they periodically submit evidence for review. This evidence is published via the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). These claims are then reviewed and approved or rejected by Verifiers.","Once evidence is confirmed by Verifiers, the Changescape intakes the data provided to assign a quantity of Change Credits to be created and mints them via the project's TBA.","With Change Credits minted and available via the TBA, the project's Partners can redeem their IOUs and receive their proportional share of Change Credits."]},{"l":"Change Credit Ownership","p":["Beyond forming the economic basis for Mutual Money, Change Credits create a special relationship between Partners and the Good Generators they back. As can be seen in the schema for Change Credits, contributions to project's are represented as NFTs, meaning that each contribution, regardless of size, still creates a single token. The reasoning behind this decision is, at least in part, a statement of values from Change Code that all contributions matter and should be recognized.","When it comes to the rights conferred to Change Credit holders (Partners), each project's Good Generator is required to specify. They can choose to select and calibrate any (or all) of the following."]},{"l":"Voting Power","p":["Good Generators can use Change Credits to include their Partners in decision making processes. These can be small decisions or large decisions, implemented on a one-time or ongoing basis. Additionally, Good Generators can select how to allocate voting power. Each NFT holder can be given a single vote or alternatively the Balance can be used so that Partners representing larger economic interest are given larger influence."]},{"l":"Exclusive Access","p":["It is not uncommon for organizations producing positive externalities host events, whether social, cultural, or academic, where attendance is in high demand. Change Credits can be used to grant access to these events."]},{"l":"Credit Retirement","p":["Certain Good Generators may be social enterprises, capable of producing both profit and positive externalities, or may be engaged in various forms of blended finance. In either case, there will be Good Generators who may be both capable of and interested in offering an economic incentive to further entice Partners to support their positive work. One means to realize this alignment is through Change Credit retirement."]}],[{"l":"Impact Verification","p":["The Changescape is designed as an impact maximizing protocol, meaning that every design decision is intended to drive capital and interest toward projects producing positive externalities most efficiently and effectively. Instead of focusing on social validation or popularity, the Changescape centers the concept of verification in the protocol so that primary impact representation in the system, Change Credits, are only ever minted from verified impact, rather than from mere claims of impact."]},{"l":"Ethereum Attestation Service","p":["In order to accomplish this verification and ensure maximum interoperability with the broader space, Change Code leverages the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS).","EAS relies on schemas to structure the data provided as attestations that can be viewed either publicly or with specified permissions. As can be seen here, Change Code has two separate schemas defined. The first schema, the claim schema, is used by Good Generators to publish their claim attestations, the evidence they provide to substantiate their work and the impact produced. The second schema is used by Verifiers, after having reviewed the claims attestations, to denote either their acceptance or rejection of the claims made and to provide their quantification of the amount of impact produced."]},{"l":"Verification Flow","p":["As shown in the above sequence diagram, the process of verification can (and often will) be carried out as a loop. As a project is implemented over a period of weeks, months, or even years, the Good Generator may periodically submit claim attestations on recent accomplishments and evidence. As soon as these claims are available (or at some pre-arranged cadence), Verifiers may review this data and submit their own attestations. Finally, with these review attestations published, the Changescape programmatically mints Change Credits in accordance with the impact quantity specified by the Verifiers.","By allowing for interim data reporting, the protocol enables Verifiers to have access to data in a more timely manner, which in practice enables more robust dispute or follow up. Additionally, with this setup, Change Credits are available to Partners sooner than if all reporting were unnecessarily forced to only occur at the end of a project's timeline."]},{"l":"Verifiers","p":["Verifiers are experts impact measurement and evaluation selected to review data provided by Good Generators and assess the veracity and quantity of impact generated. When a project is instantiated, Verifers are specified along with an approval quorum. For example, a project may have listed 3 potential verifiers with any 2 being required to approve the project's claims for Change Credits to be issue.","When it comes to the quantity of Change Credits to be issued, this number is obtained by a simple average of the all quantities reported by each approving Verifier.","In the initial iteration of the Changescape, Verifiers are proposed by a project's Good Generator and approved by Change Code based on their expertise while confirming they are free from any conflicts of interest. In future versions of the protocol, this process is set to be upgraded to have Verifiers organized as a collective (or DAO) with the ability to control its own membership."]}],[{"l":"Change Credit Retirement","p":["When a Good Generator is able concurrently generate positive impact and traditional revenue, an opportunity emerges to further align interests between themselves and their Partners. These social enterprises may leverage Change Credits to jump start their work in producing green energy, developing affordable housing, lowering the cost of healthcare or education, or achieving almost any other means of positive change that can also produce revenue.","A more traditional model for these social enterprises would be to offer equity or debt from their organizations where the positive impact is seen and structured as merely an ancillary benefit. The shortcoming in such a model is that there is no economic value ascribed to the impact externality itself, but the cost is still present. Imagine a company that made tables and chairs but could only sell its tables, while being expected to produce and distribute its chairs without payment. Would this company be able to effectively compete for capital against a business that produced and sold only tables without the deadweight of chair production.","The Changescape is different. Inside the Changescape, positive externalities are seen as economic goods unto themselves. In support of this paradigm shift, instead of selling equity or debt with blended returns, social enterprises can instead commit funds to repurchase and retire their Change Credits."]},{"l":"Retirement Flow","p":["The above sequence diagram offers an overview of the steps of Change Credit retirement, which is described in greater detail across 6 steps.","Before any of the above interactions take place, the Good Generator may optionally specify a target or even guaranteed amount of funds that will be used to repurchase and retire its Change Credits. This target can be published as part of deploying the project inside the Changescape or may simply be disseminated through the organizations usual channels communication.","Once funds are available (and after Change Credits have already begun to be distributed), the Good Generator would remit funds into the project's Treasury Account.","With funds available in the account, the Good Generator must specify how retirement will occur--declaring the price they are willing to pay for each Change Credit received and optionally setting a maximum fraction of each Change Credit that may be retired.","Partners holding Change Credits may now signal themselves as interested in retirement, optionally setting their own maximum retirement portion.","As Partners signal interest in retirement, the Treasury Account automatically distributes funds and updates the Balance and Retirement values of participating Change Credits accordingly."]}],[{"l":"Monetary Primer","p":["The idea of dollar voting or \"voting with your wallet\" has been a recognized phenomenon for about the past 50 or 75 years. The notion has a great deal of intuitive appeal as well. We work hard for our money, so why wouldn't we want what we spend our money on to align with our values and how we see ourselves?","One could even argue that the community currency movement, those attempts to create currencies specific to local communities, is a philosophical cousin to the idea of dollar voting. Both spring from the idea that money isn't currently but can be aligned with our own values and goals.","Unfortunately, it is not difficult to find major shortcomings in both movements, which we'll jointly refer to as value-based monetary movements. Dollar voting struggles in the face of gross information asymmetry between consumers and producers--greenwashing, pinkwashing, etc. Additionally, nearly all demonstrable benefits from community currency can only be found in those select situations where communities suffer from major swings in seasonal liquidity, as in the case of smallholder farming communities that only have 1 or 2 harvests a year ( Zeller, 2020)."]},{"l":"Principles of Sound Money","p":["Conventional wisdom states that there are 3 necessary functions that an asset must perform to be considered good or effective money.","Medium of exchange. The money can be used easily and effectively to realize the exchange of goods and services. Tangibly, for a money to be an effective medium of exchange, a participant must be able to physically or digitally bring the money to a place of commerce (like a store) and have the confidence to reasonably expect that their money will be accepted in exchange for what they wish to purchase.","Unit of account. The function of being a unit of account is arguably related to that of being a medium of exchange. Money used as a unit of account provides common units that can be assigned to the price of different goods and services for the purposes of comparison and evaluation. If a participant is told that Store A has the item they want for 50 #s and Store B is selling it for 46 #s, then #s are a good money only if they can rely upon those two statements to know that Store B is offering the better deal.","Store of value. The most discussed (and most challenging) role for a money is that as a store of value. A good form of money will be able to purchase a constant or near constant basic of goods even over time. The strong form of this requirement is arguably impossible, as baskets of goods and the real cost involved in production change over time, or even not advisable, if one is especially concerned about sticky wages. However, what we'll call the weak form of the requirement, that good money lose its value slowly (<3% a year) and predictably, is broadly agreed upon by economists and (ordinarily) achieved by the world's major central banks.","Beyond these 3 broadly agreed to functions of money, we believe that money ideally has two additional functions that closely relate to both the successes and failures of value-based monetary movements."]},{"l":"Economic Counterweight","p":["The key feature of economic thought and monetary decision making over the past 75 years is the notion that good money is countercyclical, playing the role of an economic counterweight to prevailing conditions. When an economy is struggling, making money cheaper or easier to obtain, can help boost growth. Conversely, if it looks as though an economy may be ballooning at an unsustainable pace that's likely to pop, then money can be made more expensive and scarcer.","In with fiat money, this function is carried out primarily through the adjustment of interest rates. In the case of community currencies in agricultural areas of the Global South, the increased access to funds during outside of the harvest windfall also acts as a counterweight, providing easier access to money exactly when it is needed to prevent activity from seizing up due to a shortage of liquidity. Because the issue of seasonally restricted liquidity is largely unique to these communities, community currencies (backed by development aid) play a unique countercyclical role that is not present in the experiments carried out in the Global North."]},{"l":"Collective Subsidy","p":["As conventional monetary policy transitioned from gold to fiat, and the idea of countercyclical currency rose, the concept of seigniorage has become thought of as a artifact. Seigniorage is defined as the difference between the cost of producing a currency and the value for which it can be sold or distributed. A archetypal example of seigniorage emerges when a government issuing gold or silver currency begins mixing in less precious metals but keeps the face value of the coins constant. The cost of producing the currency has been reduced, the value brought in remains the same (at least initially), so seigniorage increases.","While seigniorage in fiat currencies is less obvious or direct, the same result is achieved because the central bank acts as a sink for government debt. Since fiat currency is backed, by government debt, there is more demand (at a lower cost) for the government's debt than would exist otherwise, resulting in a reduced cost of capital for the state.","Provided the function is not used to excess, the creation of seigniorage is an important role for good money as it can provide a key means for a state to finance its operations. This role can be especially powerful for newer or emerging states that may have more tenuous tax base. If we think beyond the nation state, we can see seigniorage as a means for communities, movements, or network states to bootstrap capital for themselves or in the furtherance of common values.","It is this final prong of good money, the constructive direction of seigniorage that is a far more powerful tool toward a value-based monetary system."]}],[{"l":"Currency Minting","p":["The lifecycle of a Change Credit can end in 3 different ways. First, a holder could continue to hold (or circulate) the token in perpetuity, allowing each holder to exercise whatever rights may be imprinted in the token by the Good Generator who created it. Second, the Change Credit may be purchased and retired, either completely or partially, by the issuing Good Generator. Finally, the Change Credit can be monetized.","While the process of retirement enables Good Generators to buy up and retire (burn) the credits they've issued, the process of monetization encompasses the entire Changescape. When monetized, Change Credits become the basis for a unique value-aligned currency, Mutual Money."]},{"l":"Monetization","p":["Fiat money is created through a process known as debt monetization, through which a central bank purchases state debt and then issues currency against the value of that debt. This introduces a constant source of demand for the state's debt thereby reducing borrowing costs and effectively subsidizing spending. The seigniorage produced through monetization is a powerful means of collective support by users of a currency toward the state issuing the underlying debt.","This idea of monetization and seigniorage can be reimagined for nearly any set of community values, where adoption of the currency mechanistically supports the realization and furtherance of the community's value system. With this in mind, we propose that Change Credits, and the positive externalities they represent, can be monetized through Mutual Money.","more information coming soon"]}],[{"l":"Hypercerts","p":["Change Code leverages the Hypercerts protocol, itself developed from the ERC1155 token standard for semi-fungible tokens. While adhering to the requirements of the standard, Change Code modifies how some of the schema fields are used, adapting them to our theory of change and implementation needs."]},{"l":"ERC1155 Fields","p":["The Hypercert name mirrors the name used for a project's IOUs. The concept of an index is again used to support single organizations working across multiple initiatives.","A description, not exceeding 200 characters, of the work to be done by the project.","While the image field is required by the Hypercerts standard, we do not believe a single immutable image to be valuable for the purposes of serious impact validation.

For example, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or the Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF). Because the Hypercerts data is only aspirational, it would be premature to immutably publish indicators, which are instead reserved to be published only once verified inside Change Credits.","The time period during which impact outcomes will be measured and calculated. For Hypercerts inside the Changescape, the start time is set equal to the start time for the work_timeframe while the end time is set for the end of the work period plus five (5) years. Again this data is represented as an ordered pair of UTC timestamps.","A list of participants (organizations) that are contributing to the work done in the project. Each element in the list is composed of an on-chain address, a name, and a weight. The purpose of the weight is to signal relative contribution and may optionally be used to weight distributions among contributors.","As of version 1.0 of the Hypercerts standard, this value can only be set to public display.

This is then followed by the name of the Good Generator and an index. The purpose of the index is to differentiate between different projects from one Good Generator.","The abbreviated token symbol begins \"CC-IOU\" and is followed by a project ID, where the project ID is composed of the unique ID assigned to the project's Good Generator followed by the project's index value.","The supply of a project's IOUs will vary over its lifecycle. Initially, a target number of tokens as specified in the project's hypercert will be minted and held in the project's token bound account. As IOUs are redeemed for Change Credits, the IOUs returned to the TBA are subsequently burned.","IOUs are implemented including the ERC20Capped extension.

It is important to note that this is a separate requirement from the creation of a project's Hypercert. As can be seen from Change Code's Hypercert specification, the Hypercert is published before a project's work begins and accordingly would not have any information regarding results.","Every attestation must link to the Hypercert of the project for which it is claiming impact.

This is indicated by the inclusion of [] in each.","While not explicitly part of the attestation schema, claim attestations made inside the Changescape include a modified version of the Attestor Resolver contract in order to allow Good Generator's submitting claims to name specific Verifiers along with a quorum of those Verifiers required for the claim to be considered verified.","We recognize that having Good Generator's list allowed Verifiers may create issues of objectivity or conflict. In future versions of the Changescape, this setup will be replaced with a form of token gating through which only recognized experts can stake a form of reputation to evaluate projects."]},{"l":"Verification Schema","p":["The second attestation schema structures verifications (or refutations) in reference to impact claims so that Change Credits can be appropriately issued.","Every attestation must link to the Hypercert of the project being reviewed. As with the claim schema, this is accomplished by including the Hypercert's unique 32 byte identifier.","This boolean field is used by Verifiers to either accept (true) or reject (false) the proposed set of impact units.","Provided an impact unit is accepted, this field captures the quantity of impact produced according to the attesting Verifier.","IPFS reference to any documentation the Verifier wishes to provide.","As described in the Change Credit verification flow, data may be provided by a Good Generator periodically across multiple submissions as the project progresses over time. Because of this flexibility, a single Hypercert may see multiple claim attestations made, consequently the hypercertID is not sufficient to uniquely identify a claim. To resolve this, each verification attestation points to a corresponding claim attestation through an refUID."]},{"l":"Data Storage","p":["Because the Changescape is designed as a cross-chain or multi-chain protocol, the matter of data storage for attestations is especially important. EAS supports either on-chain or off-chain attestation storage, with the former option being both more expensive and more conducive to a single chain experience.","Changescape attestations are instead stored off-chain via the Ceramic Network, a decentralized database network that supports InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

The motivation to use non-fungible tokens, used most commonly as digital collectibles or as tools to control membership access, is two fold.","First, Good Generators may elect to confer invitations to events or provide partner only forms of communication or community. These uses of \"token gating\" are well solved by NFTs as they provide clearest binary between partners (those who hold a project's NFT) and others. The second consideration for constructing Change Credits as NFTs is admittedly more abstract. While there is no ignoring the fact that larger contributions to projects can have a larger impact, it is important to emphasize and embrace the idea that simply partnering for impact in the first place and at any level of contribution is the most important step one can take.","Change Credits are implemented as follows:","The token name assigned to each set of Change Credits always begins with \"CC\".
