Welcome to the Change Code Knowledgebase. At Change Code we're building the tools for individuals and organizations to attest to and verify their impact and package that data into a meaningfully representative impact asset. Ultimately, the goal of these assets is to provide an unrestricted but still accountable revenue stream, reducing the cost of social enterprise and eventually removing the need for continuous and unpredictable outside funding. Change Code is creating financial and data primitives that reliably and scalably represent impact outputs, and just as importantly, longer-term impact outcomesâ€”pioneering token-based representations of consumable and capital impact assets.

At the core of Change Code's work is our belief that in order to actually achieve the world's sustainability and other impact goals, we must find a way to *make purpose profitable*. We are working to pioneer new financial primitives and tokenomics that will see impact itself emerge as the next asset class to be powered by web3.

The __Changescape__ is a multi-chain and multi-token dApp (decentralized application) engineered to support the tokenization, verification, and ultimate monetization of a new asset category, positive impact.
