# Contribution Guide

## Community Conduct

We are all people, all community members first, and developers second. All developers and other contributors agree to uphold Change Code's rules of [Community Conduct](./community-conduct.md).

## Contributing

Change Code strives to work in public and release code as open source whenever possible. If you would like to contribute to any of our repositories just follow the steps below.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch-name`).
3. Make your changes
4. Commit any changes you've made (`git commit -am 'commit description'`).
5. Push the code to your forked origin (`git push origin feature-branch-name`)
6. Navigate back to the Change Code repository you forked from and create a new pull request.

When making a pull request, do your best to describe the changes made and your motivations for doing so. While we're excited for your to participate alongside us, please understand that certain changes may not align with the our current roadmap or requirements. If we're unable to incorporate your work, we'll always do our best to explain why.

To join our discussions, you can find us over on [Console](https://app.console.xyz/c/changecode). We always welcome new voices!

## Issue Reporting

If you have a feature request or encounter a bug in any of our work, we invite you to report it with a Github issue in the relevant repository. We've provided pre-templates to help improve reporting.

## Commitment to Open Source Code

Change Code is committed to open source code. The majority of our work is released under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL2)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).
